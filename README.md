# RbCall

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yohm/rb_call.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yohm/rb_call)

## What's this

A library to call Ruby methods from a Python script.
You can combine a Python script and Ruby libraries.

## Getting Started

Use Ruby 2.x.

Install the dependent gems as follows.

```
gem install bundler
bundle
```

Use Python 3 and then install the following dependencies.

```
pip install msgpack-rpc-python
```

To verify the installation, execute a sample script.

```
python rb_call.py
```

## Usage

Here is a sample code.
Call `RubySession()` to invoke a Ruby process. The following sample demonstrate how to use RubySession object.

```py3
rb = RubySession()                            # Launch a Ruby process
rb.require("json")                            # `require "json"`
JSON = rb.const('JSON')                       # get JSON class (This is a Ruby class.)
print( JSON.dump( ['foo','bar','baz'] ) )     # call method against JSON class

Dir = rb.const('Dir')                         # get another class `Dir`
for f in Dir.glob('*'):                       # iterate over an object of Ruby
    print(f)                                  # Array of Ruby is mapped to list of Python

json_string = '{"a": 1, "b":2, "c":3}'
parsed = JSON.load( json_string )             # parse JSON string using Ruby's JSON
for k,v in parsed.items():                    # Hash of Ruby is mapped to dict of Python
    print(k, v)

rb.require('./sample_class')                  # load a Ruby library 'test.rb'
MyClass = rb.const('MyClass')                 # get a Class defined in 'test.rb'
obj = MyClass('a')                            # create an instance of MyClass
print( obj, repr(obj) )                       # when printing a Ruby object, `to_s` method is called
print( obj.inspect() )                        # all Ruby methods are available.
print( dir(obj) )                             # dir invokes `public_methods` in Ruby
print( obj.m1(), obj.m2(1,2), obj.m3(3,b=4) ) # You can call Ruby methods with args. Keyword arguments are also available.

proc = obj.m4('arg of proc')                  # a Ruby method that returns a Proc
print( "proc:", proc() )                      # calling proc

try:
    obj.m2()                                  # when an exception happens in Ruby, RubyException is raised
except RubyException as ex:
    print( ex.args, repr(ex.rb_exception) )   # ex.args has a message from the exception object in Ruby.

d = MyClass.cm5()                             # Hash and Array in Ruby correspond to Dictionary and List in Python
print( d )                                    #   => {1: RubyObject, 2: [1, RubyObject]}

e = MyClass.cm6()                             # Not only simple Array but an Enumerator is also supported
for i in e:                                   # You can iterate using `for` syntax over an Enumerable
    print(i)

obj2 = MyClass.cm7( obj )                     # you can pass a RubyObject as an argument
print( obj2 == obj )                          # If two objects refers to the same objects, they are regarded as same.
```

The code corresponds to the following Ruby code.

```rb
require "json"                            #    rb.require("json")
                                          #    JSON = rb.const('JSON')
puts JSON.dump( ['foo','bar','baz'] )     #    print( JSON.dump( ['foo','bar','baz'] ) )
                                          #    Dir = rb.const('Dir')
Dir.glob('*').each do |f|                 #    for f in Dir.glob('*'):
  puts f                                  #        print(f)
end                                       #
json_string = '{"a": 1, "b":2, "c":3}'    #    json_string = '{"a": 1, "b":2, "c":3}'
parsed = JSON.load( json_string )         #    parsed = JSON.load( json_string )
parsed.each do |k,v|                      #    for k,v in parsed.items():
  puts(k,v)                               #        print(k, v)
end                                       #
require './sample_class'                  #    rb.require('./sample_class')
                                          #    MyClass = rb.const('MyClass')
obj = MyClass.new('a')                    #    obj = MyClass('a')
puts obj                                  #    print( obj, repr(obj) )
puts obj.inspect                          #    print( obj.inspect() )
p obj.public_methods                      #    print( dir(obj) )
puts obj.m1, obj.m2(1,2), obj.m3(3,b:4)   #    print( obj.m1(), obj.m2(1,2), obj.m3(3,b=4))
                                          #
                                          #
proc = obj.m4('arg of proc')              #    proc = obj.m4('arg of proc')
puts "proc: #{proc.call}"                 #    print( "proc:", proc() )
                                          #
begin                                     #    try:
  obj.m2                                  #        obj.m2()
rescue => ex                              #    except RubyException as ex:
  puts ex.to_s                            #        print( ex.args, repr(ex.rb_exception) )
end                                       #
d = MyClass.cm5                           #    d = MyClass.cm5()
puts d                                    #    print( d )
                                          #
e = MyClass.cm6                           #    e = MyClass.cm6()
e.each do |i|                             #    for i in e:
  puts i                                  #        print(i)
end                                       #
obj2 = MyClass.cm7(obj)                   #    obj2 = MyClass.cm7( obj )
puts(obj2 == obj)                         #    print( obj2 == obj )
```


An instance of RubySession, `rb`, has several methods.

- `send_kernel` calls the method against the Kernel object of Ruby.
- `require` corresponds to `require` in Ruby
- `require_relative(arg)` loads a Ruby file named ***arg*** relative to the requiring file's path.
- `const` returns a constant in Ruby such as Class object
    - If you get a class, you can use it as if it is a Python class.

## Limitations

- Ruby methods which receive a block argument can not be called.
- Python object can not be passed as an argument of Ruby methods.
- Method calls against an instance of `RubyObject` is redirected to the corresponding object in Ruby. However, there are exceptions.
    - Some Ruby methods can not be used as method names in Python. For instance, `rb_obj.class()`, `rb_obj.in(...)`, or `rb_obj.is_a?(...)` is not a valid call in Python, causing a syntax error.
    - To avoid this issue, use `#send` method: `rb_obj.send('class')`.
- If you undefine the method `to_msgpack_ext`, it is not serialized properly by MessagePack. Do not undefine this method.
    - In some library, however, some classes undefine most of the public methods for metaprogramming. In that case, re-define `to_msgpack_ext` method again to avoid the problem.
        - One of such library is "mongoid". If you are using "mongoid", require "patch/mongoid_patch" after you required "mongoid" in your code.
- Stdout from the Ruby process is suppressed.

## Test

To run the test,

```
python -m unittest discover -v
```
